Here’s a **README-ready** version of your ongoing internship project description, structured with clarity and professionalism:

---

# 🤖 Robotic Co. – Full-Stack MERN Robotics + E-Commerce Web App *(Ongoing Internship)*

This project is a full-stack web application that merges an e-commerce platform with real-time 3D robot simulation and control. Developed as part of an ongoing internship, it integrates modern web technologies to provide a unique interactive robotics experience through both UI and gesture-based control.

---

## 🌐 Features

### 🛍️ E-Commerce System

* Browse products, manage cart, and perform secure checkout (Stripe initially, with support for modular payment gateways).
* Full authentication flow with JWT-based login/signup and protected user routes.

### 🦾 3D Robot Simulation

* Upload and visualize custom robots using URDF files and STL/DAE mesh assets.
* Rendered in-browser using Three.js with dynamic lighting, shadows, and ground plane.

### 🎮 Joint Control Interface

* Joints are parsed from URDF and exposed as interactive sliders.
* Real-time joint manipulation via slider input mapped to robot articulation.

### ✋ Gesture-Based Control (MediaPipe)

* MediaPipe Hands integration allows hand gestures to control robot joints.
* Browser-based tracking—no external device required.

### 💻 Responsive & Modular UI

* Built using React and Vite with modular components.
* Clean, responsive CSS layout for mobile and desktop.
